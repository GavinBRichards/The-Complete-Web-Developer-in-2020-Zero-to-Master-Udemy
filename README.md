# The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Master Udemy

All of my work for the Udemy course (The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery)
found here https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/

After completing my portfolio I wanted to tackle a course from beginning to end. Having already known the majority of this course, I figured it would be a good refresher while also learning and honing new skills.
